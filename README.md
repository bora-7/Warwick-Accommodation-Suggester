## Description

Find the accommodation that suits you the best with the Accommodation Suggester!

 Simply choose all the factors **that matter to you**, and be recommended a list of accommodations that match your criteria. This is a tool that I wish existed when I was choosing an accommodation in the Summer of 2020. Warwick's official website has a list of all the accommodations but does not let you filter based on specific attributes. 

 I decided to make this tool myself after finishing my first year studying Computer Science. It was fun to make and I hope you've found it useful.
